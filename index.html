    <h2>Favourites</h2>
    <p>
      Two times champion <strong>Tadej Pogacar </strong> will be the man to beat. Despite finishing second last year, he has returned stronger, more matured and motivated and in the start of 2023 he is proving everyone he is stronger than ever. <strong> Jonas Vingegaard </strong>, last year's champion, will try to defend his title. A really dangerous climber and really complete rider with an extremelly strong team. Other candidates are: french young rider <strong>David Gaudu</strong>, <strong>Simon Yates</strong>, <strong>Jai Hindley</strong> and colombian <strong>Daniel Felipe Martinez</strong> (in case he starts as the leader).
